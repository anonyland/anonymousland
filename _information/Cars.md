### __Introduction__

Most modern cars contain an EDR, Electronic Data Recorder.
This device is also commonly known as a "black box".
This device contains detailed information such as vehicle speed, detailed engine information along with the vehicles occupancy status.

This device is able to be read via a simple USB dongle.
The EDR is able to use the on-board pressure sensors embedded in the driver and passenger seats to have information such as how many passengers were in the vehicle, along with the status of seat belts.

While this is used for safety purposes, it is an extreme privacy invasion.
This page is not to describe on why you might want to care about privacy, but rather an overview on the privacy concern of modern cars.

Most modern cars include "smart features", such as an embedded display usually running a version of Android.
These devices will be referred to as a "smart screen".
The smart screen has the ability to connect to the internet along with providing apps such as Spotify, and some sort of GPS / navigational system.

A concern of these devices is the lack of security consideration.
These devices have access to extremely sensitive information such as location and potentially account information granted that an account is signed in.
Often times, these devices to not receive proper security patches or even updates to the OS in general.
