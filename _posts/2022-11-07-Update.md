We have been having a lot of updates recently. All anonymousland repositories have been added to our new [Git instance](https://git.anonymousland.org) and this has been set as the upstream. We have stripped IP addresses from reaching the Synapse instance by adding:

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For 0.0.0.0;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP 0.0.0.0;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host 0.0.0.0;
```

into the nginx configuration. This means that your sessions will no longer be identifiable by IP addresses and that Synapse will no longer be able to see your IP address. Nginx logging is also disabled too.

Other Synapse news:

- Updated to v1.70.1
- Added workers which will provide additional performance
- Shrunk the database from ~79GB to ~39GB
- Docker images are all built locally and set to rebuild every 24 hours
- Synapse state compressor is set to run every 24 hours
- We have implemented a privacy-respecting captcha for registration. Register [here](https://matrix.anonymousland.org/register)
- The Synapse Docker image can be found [here](https://git.anonymousland.org/anonymousland/synapse-docker)
- Bcrypt rounds have been changed from `15` to `16`

We plan to host a lot more services soon! You can help fund this project by donating [here](https://anonymousland.org/donate). To stay up-to-date, join #lounge on Matrix and follow along on Git.
