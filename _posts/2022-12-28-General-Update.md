Greetings, it is time for a general update on our services and various things that have been happening.
A general look at some of our newer services:

- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.anonymousland.org)
- [Schild](https://schild.anonymousland.org)
- [OTS](https://ots.anonymousland.org)
- [Paste](https://paste.anonymousland.org)

Not to mention our [Matrix](https://element.anonymousland.org) server and our [Onion Matrix](http://ps3364wgpvq46iumfm7wcewr3qxymtnd2fo753gvngzbumir7wyrlvad.onion/), with Synapse being located at: ``http://7pdtdadfcjvntnbip764d5sc35d2s7hhdkbbie5hy7njovea4534vxqd.onion/``.

We've also added a [Transparency](./transparency) page to give a brief overview of our servers and services.

We've removed the auto-join feature for increased privacy on our Matrix instance.
Come join the community in our [lounge](https://matrix.to/#/#lounge:anonymousland.org).

We are always looking for contributors, you can contribute to our main site at [https://git.anonymousland.org/anonymousland](https://git.anonymousland.org/anonymousland/anonymousland) .
