#### __Authentication__

Multi-factor authentication is extremely important as it provides multiple layers to your account even if your password is compromised.

#### __Browser__

Your browser contains everything you do. It is the main entry point onto your system, along with the main privacy & security risk.

#### __Email Providers__

Email is a nessecary evil that is required in this world. Email is inherently insecure, which means your email provider can read any of your messages. These providers offer encryption, anonymity and security. 

- [Proton](https://proton.me) <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-info"><a href="https://protonmailrmez3lotccipshtkleegetolb73fuirgj7r4o4vfu7ozyd.onion">Tor</a></button>
- [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com)

#### Aliases

This provides multiple aliases for your emails, so you do not have to reveal your true email address. This is extremely useful especially if you are worried about your email being leaked.

- [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/)
- [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/)

<br>

#### __Messengers__

Your messages must be secure as they reveal a lot about you. Choosing an encrypted messenger will prevent any unauthorized users from reading any of your messages.

<br>

##### Decentralized

- [Matrix](https://matrix.org)
- [XMPP](https://xmpp.org)
- [Session](https://getsession.org)

<br>

##### Centralized

##### P2P

- [Briar](https://briarproject.org) (Mobile)

<br>

#### __Operating System__

Your operating system is the most important part, if it is insecure then you can assume any activities done are also compromised.

- [Tails](https://tails.boum.org)
- [Whonix](https://whonixproject.org) <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-info"><a href="http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/">Tor</a></button>

- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) (Mobile)

<br>

#### __Password Managers__

Password managers are a great way to both securely and remember all of your passwords. Your passwords are saved in an encrypted database, which you only need to remember 1 password while generating secure passwords for all of your accounts.

- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)

<br>

#### __Search Engine__

Your search engine knows a lot about you. This information is often times sold to 3rd parties and given away to government agencies. They often show biased search results. Choose a better one here.
